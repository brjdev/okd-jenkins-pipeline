# OpenShift Ephemeral Jenkins Pipeline

This project represents an implementation of an Ephemeral Jenkins Pipeline for production use.  It is intentionally Ephemeral so that users don't have to deal with managing Jenkins.  There are two developer pipelines included, one for Spring Boot applications, and one for Quarkus JMV applications.
